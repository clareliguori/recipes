recipe:
  servings: 8 half-pint jars
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 3 1/2 c spicy pineapple juice (see below)
    * 1/2 c white vinegar

    * 2 jalapeno peppers, sliced
  directions_markdown: |-
    Make the spicy pineapple juice:
    1. Strain the pineapple juice through 4 layers of cheesecloth.
    1. Add the sliced jalapenos (including the seeds) into the juice. Let sit for 2 minutes, then strain through a sieve. _Note:_ This will give just a hint of spicy jalapeno flavor to the jelly. The juice may taste spicy at this point, but the added sugar later mellows out the flavor quite a bit. If you want a spicier jelly, let the jalapenos sit in the juice for longer.
    1. Filter the juice mixture through 1 coffee filter.
    1. Measure out 3 1/2 cups of filtered juice.

    Make the jelly:
    1. Combine the spicy pineapple juice and vinegar in a pot.
    1. Over medium heat, heat the juice until warm.
    1. Add the sugar and heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved.
    1. Increase the heat to medium high and bring the mixture to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly.
    1. Stir in the pectin. Return the mixture to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Boil, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove the pot from heat.
    1. Skim off any foam and ladle into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Process jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.
