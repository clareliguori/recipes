recipe:
  servings: 12 rock cakes
  prep: 1 hour 30 minutes
  cook: 20 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 cup diced rhubarb (about 1.5 - 2 stalks)
    * 1 cup diced strawberries
    * 2 tbsp white sugar
    * 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
    * 1/3 cup brown sugar
    * 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
    * 1/2 tsp baking soda
    * 3 tsp ground cinnamon
    * 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
    * 1/2 tsp ground allspice
    * 1/4 tsp ground cloves
    * 1/4 tsp ground ginger
    * 6 tbsp butter, cold and sliced
    * 1 egg
    * 1 tsp vanilla extract
    * 1 cup milk
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Toss rhubarb, strawberries, and white sugar to combine in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap and let macerate in the fridge for 1-2 hours.
    1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and spices to combine.
    1. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the egg, vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup of the milk.
    1. Rub the butter into the flour mixture by hand until you have a breadcrumb consistency.
    1. Drain the fruit mixture in a sieve set over a bowl. Add 2 tbsp of the fruit syrup to the egg mixture.
    1. Pat the strained fruit mixture with paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible. Mix the fruit into the flour mixture until the fruit is coated in flour.
    1. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, and stir with a spatula to combine.
    1. Stir in small amounts of the remaining milk into the dough until it comes together, up to 1/4 cup of milk at a time.
    The consistency should be a bit drier than the soft dropping consistency I aim for with my [regular rock cakes](rock-cakes),
    because the fruit will release more moisture as it bakes.
    1. Scoop the dough onto the parchment lined baking sheet using an ice cream scoop, forming 12 rough dough balls. The goal is not a perfect ball, because we want the craggy texture of a rock cake.
    1. Bake at 400F for 15 - 20 minutes until golden at the top and around the edges. If you tap the bottom of a rock cake, it should sound hollow (though some might not if the fruit is close to the bottom of the rock cake). Cool on a wire rack.

    Notes:

    Avoid the butter melting as much as possible before getting the rock cakes into the oven.
    Measure out all the ingredients before starting to ensure you can work quickly once the butter is rubbed in.
    Leave the butter in the fridge until immediately before rubbing it into flour.
    Before rubbing in the butter by hand, rinse hands with very cold water to make your hands as cold as possible.
