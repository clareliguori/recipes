    * 4 tsp Pomona's calcium water

    Clarified lemon juice:
    * 8 c freshly squeezed lemon juice, strained
    * Agar-agar powder

    Clarify the lemon juice:
    1. Weigh the lemon juice on a kitchen scale and take note of the weight. Let's say you get 1800 grams.
    1. Measure out about 2 c water into a small pot, but weigh it to get exactly 1/4 of the weight of your lemon juice. With the example of 1800 g of lemon juice, you would need 450 g of water.
    1. Measure out the agar-agar powder into the water. You need 0.2% of the juice weight. With the example of 1800 g of lemon juice, you would need 3.6 g of agar-agar powder (it is ok to round up to 4 g if your kitchen scale only does whole gram measurements).
    1. Whisk the agar and the water together, then heat to a boil, stirring constantly. Let simmer a couple of minutes to hydrate the agar.
    1. While briskly whisking the boiling-hot agar mixture, slowly add the lemon juice in a thin stream.
    1. Put the mixture on an ice bath to set.
    1. Using a whisk, gently break up and stir the gel into agar curds.
    1. Dump the curds into a cheesecloth lined strainer. Lift and gently squeeze the cheesecloth to drain the clarified juice, occasionally stirring the curds in the cheesecloth to release more juice.
    1. If necessary, strain the clarified juice through a clean layer of cheesecloth to remove any larger agar clumps that slipped through.

    Make the jelly:
    1. Combine the clarified lemon juice and calcium water in a pot.
    1. Mix together the sugar and pectin powder in a separately bowl, making sure they are thoroughly mixed.
    1. Bring the juice mixture to a boil. Add the pectin-sugar mixture; stir vigorously 1-2 minutes to dissolve the sugar. Return to a boil and remove from heat.
    1. Ladle into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Process jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.

This jelly won Best in Class and Best in Show ribbons at the 2016 [Kitsap County Fair](https://www.kitsapfair.org/).
It is pictured in the middle, among my other entries to the fair that year.

When I picked up the ribbons at the end of the fair, one of the judges asked me "How did you get your lemon jelly to be so clear?!".

This recipe was mostly a science experiment of how clear I could make a citrus jelly for competition.
Transparency is one of the most important criteria for judging jellies in competition, and citrus juice is very cloudy.
In my experience, the usual straining tools of cheesecloth and coffee filters don't work well with citrus juice.
The juice seems to lose all its flavor and color in the process, and still comes out somewhat cloudy.

In this recipe, I adapted a technique from the food science world for clarifying juices using agar-agar powder,
as described in the [Cooking Issues blog](https://cookingissues.com/2009/07/14/agar-clarification-made-stupid-simple-best-technique-yet/).
Agar-agar powder is sometimes used for making lemon jello-type jellies and candies, instead of gelatin.
In this clarification technique, the lemon juice is temporarily gelled using the agar juice (pictured below) and then strained out of the gel,
leaving the particles in the juice stuck to the agar gel and yielding a clear juice.

The resulting lemon jelly did not have a very strong lemon flavor, but was sparkling clear and bright yellow.
Reducing the lemon juice a bit in the beginning could potentially help to give the jelly a stronger lemon flavor.
