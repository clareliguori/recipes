recipe:
  servings: 12 buns
  prep: 15 minutes
  cook: 15 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
    * 1/3 cup brown sugar
    * 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
    * 1/2 tsp baking soda
    * 3 tsp ground cinnamon
    * 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
    * 1/2 tsp ground allspice
    * 1/4 tsp ground cloves
    * 1/4 tsp ground ginger
    * 6 tbsp butter, cold and sliced
    * 1 egg
    * 1 tsp vanilla extract
    * 1/2 cup golden raisins
    * 1/3 cup dried currants
    * 1/2 cup milk
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda to combine.
    1. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the egg, vanilla extract, and half of the milk (1/4 cup).
    1. Rub the butter into the flour mixture by hand until you have a breadcrumb consistency.
    1. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, and stir with a spatula to combine. If the dough does not come together, add small amounts of the remaining milk until the dough just comes together.
    1. Fold in the raisins and currants, half at a time.
    1. Scoop the dough onto the parchment lined baking sheet using an ice cream scoop, forming 12 rough dough balls.
    1. Bake at 400F for 12 - 15 minutes until golden at the top and around the edges. If you tap the bottom of the bun, it should sound hollow. Cool on a wire rack.

    Notes:
    Avoid the butter melting as much as possible before getting the buns into the oven.
    Measure out all the ingredients before starting to ensure you can work quickly once the butter is rubbed in.
    Leave the butter in the fridge until immediately before rubbing it into flour.
    Before rubbing in the butter, rinse hands with very cold water.
