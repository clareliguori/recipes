    1. Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a muffin pan with cooking spray.
    1. In a small bowl, mix together the carrots and raisins. Set aside.
    1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Make sure to evenly mix the baking soda into the flour to avoid [green carrots](https://www.thekitchn.com/food-science-when-good-carrots-52210)!
    1. In a large bowl, whisk together the applesauce, egg, honey, melted butter, and vanilla extract.
    1. Stir half of the flour mixture into the applesauce mixture until combined. Fold the carrots and raisins into the batter. Then add the remaining flour mixture and stir to combine.
    1. Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into each cup in the muffin pan, using an ice cream scoop.
    1. Bake for 22 - 27 minutes at 350F, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
    1. Let cool in the muffin pan for 2 minutes, then let cool completely on a wire rack.

    To make this as a carrot-raisin quick bread, use an 8x8 square baking pan. Bake for 25-27 minutes.
