    * 1 package store-bought pie crusts, such as Pillsbury
    * 1 cup mincemeat (see note)
    * 1 egg

    Equipment:

    1. Preheat the oven to 400F.
    1. Unroll one pie crust. Use a round cookie cutter slightly larger than the pie pan's cups to cut out 12 circles to form the bottom crusts for the mince pies. Gently press a crust circle into each hole.
    1. Spoon mincemeat into each crust in the pie pan. Do not overfill; the mincemeat should be at most level with the top of the crust.
    1. Unroll the other pie crust. Use a round cookie cutter slightly smaller than the pie pan's cups to form the top crusts for the mince pies. Place the crust circles on top of the mincemeat. You can also use decorative shapes for the top crusts, like star-shaped cookie cutters.
    1. Brush tops with an egg wash (beat the egg with 1 tbsp water).
    1. Bake at 400F for 13 - 18 minutes until the tops are golden brown.
    1. Allow to cool slightly in the trays and then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
    1. Optional: Dust pies with powdered sugar.

    Notes:

    You can use any kind of mincemeat with this recipe: store-bought (condensed or jarred) or homemade.
    I have previously used homemade mincemeat using [Delia Smith's recipe](https://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/books/delias-happy-christmas/home-made-christmas-mincemeat)
    and the Fruitcake Conserve recipe in [Naturally Sweet Food in Jars](https://www.amazon.com/Naturally-Sweet-Food-Jars-Preserves/dp/0762457783).
